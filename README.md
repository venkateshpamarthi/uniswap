# uniswap
This project is about swaping two erc20 tokens created by myself with names "puni" and "vky" at given specific addresses.
You can either change addresses of your desired tokens or even can take them in dynamic manner using .env Functionalities used in this project are 1.swapping exact Input token and 2. Get Estimated amount of Input Tokens to the output Tokens. No swap functionality is written in app.js. Only Get Estimated code is written to confirm about it's working. End points and integration is still needed to be done for all functionalities. This could help you as a basic standard of writtting code for required features in Uniswap.
This project requirments are web3(node_modules),nodejs,Truffle frameworks,@uniswap/periphery,@openzeppelin/contracts libraries.
You can check the puni and vky tokens in uniswap also in polygon testnet.
Quoter Address and Swap Address are available publicly in uniswap docs.
